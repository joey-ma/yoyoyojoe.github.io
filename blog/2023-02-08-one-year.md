"Being realistic is the most commonly traveled road to mediocrity."  
*- Will Smith*

<!--truncate-->

Will Smith is extremely intelligent and worldly. Here are some other things he said that I appreciated. It could be something I resonate with. It could be something to reflect on even if I don't agree with it wholeheartedly. It could be something that I absolutely need to learn to embrace.

"Concentrate on your strengths. I do everything well."^1

"There's no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A." 

“The first step, before anybody in the world believes it, is you have to believe it.” 

*Nope, he shouldn't have hit Chris Rock!*

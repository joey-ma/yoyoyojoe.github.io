"Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."  
*- Steve Jobs*

"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."

[Steve Jobs told seniors at Stanford University in 2005](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM) that dropping out of college was one of the best decisions he ever made.

"Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going, was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for work, as it is for your lover. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work, is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet. Keep looking. And don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle" ([I love this part](https://youtu.be/Hd_ptbiPoXM?t=929))

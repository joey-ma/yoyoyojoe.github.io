<em>- Steve Jobs</em></p><p>"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Jobs told seniors at Stanford University in 2005</a> that dropping out of college was one of the best decisions he ever made.</p><p>"Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going, was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for work, as it is for your lover. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work, is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet. Keep looking. And don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle" (<a href="https://youtu.be/Hd_ptbiPoXM?t=929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I love this part</a>)</p><p>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership. </p><p>Apple Computer, Inc. is incorporated on January 3, 1977, by Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak. </p><p>References: </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/steve-jobs-told-students-stay-hungry-stay-foolish/2011/10/05/gIQA1qVjOL_blog.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve Jobs told students: ‘Stay hungry.

<em>- Will Smith</em></p><p>Will Smith is extremely intelligent and worldly. Here are some other things he said that I appreciated. It could be something I resonate with. It could be something to reflect on even if I don't agree with it wholeheartedly. It could be something that I absolutely need to learn to embrace.</p><p>"Concentrate on your strengths. I do everything well."^1</p><p>"There's no reason to have a plan B because it distracts from plan A." </p><p>“The first step, before anybody in the world believes it, is you have to believe it.” </p><p><em>Nope, he shouldn't have hit Chris Rock!</em></p>]]></content>

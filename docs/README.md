# joey-ma.github.io Docs (Alpha)

## Intention

While I can't memorize everything I've learned, I'd like be able to reference useful information on demand.

The intention of these Docs were to serve me as my personal collection of notes and references: clear and concise. 

However, soon I realized this is an enormous endeavor.

## Confronting Imperfection

Recognizing that creating good documentation is a meaningful but tedious task and documenting a lesson learned (concisely) requires patience and time to process and summarize the experience, I took some time to document some of my lessons learned and saved most of my notes without having them posted.

After a while though, I realized that these notes do not exist. I'd reference my files, make small edits, and the notes are saved locally. This defeats the purpose of this Docs section of my site. The perfectionist in me will require me to either (1) remove the Docs section because it will never be perfect, (2) have 2 somewhat helpful articles for a year (they are incomplete anyways, the intention is not to replace the official docs), or (3) post these random, incomplete notes, but I can still refer back to them, and they _might_ possibly be helpful to someone.

So, I hope this can be helpful to others in addition to myself, but if you see room for improvements and would like to contribute, please feel free to create an issue so I can review it, or submit a PR to make it better! _Since I'm quite opinionated about how my Docs should look like, please reach out and see the ([Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)) before you spend a huge amount of time on this PR!_

# Python

## Getting started

To check if Python is installed on your system **and** is accessible in the `PATH` environment variable, run:

```bash
python --version
```

For example: 

```bash
joey@Joeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % python --version
zsh: command not found: python
joey@Joeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % python3.10 --version
Python 3.10.9
```

To only check if Python3.10 is accessible in the `PATH`, run:

```bash
joey@Joeys-MacBook-Pro ~ % which python3.10
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10
```

This command will output the path to the python3.10 executable if it is installed and accessible in the PATH environment variable. If the command does not produce any output, it means that python3.10 is not accessible in the PATH.



If Python is installed but not accessible in the `PATH`, you can add its installation directory to the `PATH` environment variable by running the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/python/bin
```


:::tip

  ```js
  const answerFormat = {
    Situation: `Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example`,
    Task: `Describe what your responsibility was in that situation`,
    Action: `Explain exactly what steps you took to address it`,
    Result: `Share what outcomes your actions achieved`,
  }
```

## What you'll need

- Have relevant experiences top of mind (as some would say, prepare a script)
- Talk about relevant experiences in the most clear, relatable, yet concise manner (aka, use the STAR format)
- Tons of practice (i.e., practice makes perfect)

:::note

The recruiter / hiring manager wants to get to know you.

However, because the interviews are the only short-windows of time for the interviewers to learn more about you, the person leaving the best impression during those times becomes the person who can communicate clearly during those periods of time. 

Is that a fair assessment of the candidate's ability, likability, or compatibility with your team?

From my interviewing experiences so far, it seems like yes is the answer.

### Example questions

#### Tell me about a time when you were faced with a challenging situation

```js
const example_1 = {
  Situation: `Set the scene and give the necessary details of your example`,
  Task: `Describe what your responsibility was in that situation`,
  Action: `Explain exactly what steps you took to address it`,
  Result: `Share what outcomes your actions achieved`,
}
```


#### Does `STAR Everything` follow the STAR format?

_I think so?_

```js
const STAR_Everything = {
  Situation: `Required background knowledge: Getting started`,
  Task: `Problem at hand: What you'll need`,
  Action: `Steps taken to address problem: Example questions`,
  Result: `The entire article that you've read`,
}
```

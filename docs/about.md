# About Docs (Alpha)

## Intention

While I can't memorize everything I've learned, I'd like be able to reference useful information on demand.

The intention of these Docs were to serve me as my personal collection of notes and references: clear and concise. 

## Disclaimer

As technologies are always changing, official documentations should always be the most up-to-date. However, sometimes it may be hard to find from official docs or harder to find in general. Or, I may prefer to organize and note some info that I find useful, in a way that's clear to me. This is where my docs can be helpful.

Even though the articles contents may includes random issues and solutions and may be out-of-context, I do want to share my findings in case others can find these notes useful as well.

## Confronting Imperfection

Recognizing that creating good documentation is a meaningful but tedious task and documenting a lesson learned (concisely) requires patience and time to process and summarize the experience, I took some time to document some of my lessons learned and saved most of my notes without having them posted.

After a while though, I realized that these notes do not exist. I'd reference my files, make small edits, and the notes are saved locally. This defeats the purpose of this Docs section of my site. The perfectionist in me will require me to either (1) remove the Docs section because it will never be perfect, (2) have 2 somewhat helpful articles for a year (they are incomplete anyways, the intention is not to replace the official docs), or (3) post these random, incomplete notes, but I can still refer back to them, and they __*might*__ possibly be helpful to someone.

So, I hope this can also be helpful to you, but if you would like to contribute, please feel free to create an issue so I can review it, or submit a PR to make it better! _Please reach out or create an issue before you spend a huge amount of time on a PR._ Here's a [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/yoyoyojoe/yoyoyojoe.github.io/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

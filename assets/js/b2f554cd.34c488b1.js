Don\'t lose faith. I\'m convinced that the only thing that kept me going, was that I loved what I did. You\'ve got to find what you love. And that is as true for work, as it is for your lover. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work, is to love what you do. If you haven\'t found it yet. Keep looking. And don\'t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you\'ll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don\'t settle\\" ([I love this part](https://youtu.be/Hd_ptbiPoXM?t=929))\\n\\nApple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business partnership. \\n\\nApple Computer, Inc. is incorporated on January 3, 1977, by Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak. \\n\\nReferences: \\n- [Steve Jobs told students: \u2018Stay hungry.
